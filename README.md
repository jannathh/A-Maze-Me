# A-Maze-Me
A‑Maze‑Me is an interactive maze game combining hardware and software for a fun, competitive experience. Built in Unity, it uses an Arduino-based joystick to control an avatar through the maze. Players start at the center and race to the endpoint as fast as possible. Speed and efficiency determine their leaderboard ranking.
